## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Used CSS Vars, REM and EM for measurements
- Flexbox for mobile layout
- CSS Grid for Desktop layout
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I'm used to pixels and this time, I tried using REM for font-sizes and EM for spacings and sizes. I learned that I can set the global font size to 62.5% thus it's easier now to convert pixel to REM.
```css
html {
  font-size: 62.5%;
}
```

I also tried my best to use semantic HTML5 markup, I hope i'm using it correctly. 
I'm comfortable on using Flexbox but I challenged myself this time and learned how to use CSS Grid for the desktop layout. And lastly, it's my first time to do the mobile first workflow when applying the styles. 

### Continued development

I want to practice CSS grid more, do more challenges using mobile-first workflow and improve code accessibility, readability and maintenance.
